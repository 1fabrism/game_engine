# Hazel Engine
In this repo I am following a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT), by https://github.com/TheCherno, that shows how to build a simple 2D game engine in C++.

I decided to start this tutorial because I wanted some hands on experience with a larger C++ project.
